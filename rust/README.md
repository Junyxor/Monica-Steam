# Monica Steam Rust core

This directory contains the performance-sensitive Steam protocol core and its Android JNI bridge. The migration is intentionally coarse-grained: parsing/encoding work that benefits from native execution crosses JNI once per response or operation, while Android UI, lifecycle, localization, HTTP orchestration and platform integration stay in Kotlin/Compose.

## Toolchains

- `monica-steam-core`: Rust 1.75+ (`rust-version = "1.75"`)
- `monica-steam-android`: Rust 1.77+ (`rust-version = "1.77"`), matching the current JNI dependency chain
- Android CI NDK: `27.2.12479018`
- Android minSdk: 26
- Packaged ABIs: `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`

The CI deliberately tests the core at Rust 1.75 and the complete workspace at Rust 1.77 instead of testing only the latest stable compiler.

## Current native core coverage

The Rust core now owns the coarse-grained protocol or parsing work for:

- Steam Guard auth codes, confirmation hashes and login/token signatures;
- bounded protobuf reading/writing with borrowed field views;
- Steam CM envelope encoding/decoding, multi-message payloads and web-logon bodies;
- direct-message sessions and history pages, including reactions;
- group-chat history and group/room summaries;
- owned games, achievement progress, StoreBrowse metadata and achievement detail merging;
- family shared-library apps;
- friend nickname lists;
- pending login client IDs, auth-session info and mobile-confirmation responses;
- authorized-device enumeration;
- trade-offer pages, including descriptions, nested assets and sorting;
- wishlist pages, including nested store assets and purchase options.

Production Android call sites use these paths Rust-first and retain their Kotlin implementations as compatibility fallbacks.

## Android bridge layout

`monica-steam-android/src/lib.rs` is intentionally only a module registry. JNI entry points and binary serializers are split by domain:

```text
auth_bridge.rs         auth sessions and authorized devices
chat_bridge.rs         direct-message sessions and history
cm_bridge.rs           CM envelopes and web logon
guard_bridge.rs        Steam Guard/HMAC operations
family_bridge.rs       family shared library
friend_bridge.rs       friend nickname lists
group_chat_bridge.rs   group chat/history summaries
library_bridge.rs      games, achievements and StoreBrowse metadata
trade_bridge.rs        trade offers
wishlist_bridge.rs     wishlist pages
```

Keep future coarse-grained bridges in a focused domain module instead of growing the crate root again.

## Host tests

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.75.0 1.77.0

cargo +1.75.0 test \
  --manifest-path rust/monica-steam-core/Cargo.toml \
  --all-targets

cargo +1.77.0 test \
  --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml \
  --workspace \
  --all-targets
```

## Build Android JNI libraries

Install the Android Rust targets and `cargo-ndk` first:

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi
cargo install cargo-ndk --locked
```

Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` (or `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT` / `ANDROID_NDK`) to an installed NDK, then run:

```bash
scripts/build-rust-android.sh
```

The script writes:

```text
app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libmonica_steam_android.so
app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libmonica_steam_android.so
```

Then build Android normally:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

`Steam Network CI` also verifies that both `.so` files are actually present inside the generated split APKs. Successful CI runs upload the debug APKs together with `apk-sha256.txt` and `apk-contents.txt` for device testing.

## Native bridge policy

`RustSteamCoreNative` loads `libmonica_steam_android.so` opportunistically. Every Android call site keeps a Kotlin implementation as a fallback. If the native library is unavailable, JNI throws, a parser rejects malformed input, or a versioned bridge payload fails validation, the existing Kotlin path remains available.

Do not move tiny JVM-only operations across JNI just for language consistency. A native call should cover enough work to amortize the JNI boundary. In particular, do not serialize an already-decoded Kotlin `JsonObject` back into text merely to parse it again in Rust.

## Versioned binary bridges

The JNI layer returns compact binary payloads instead of constructing large Java/Kotlin object graphs one JNI call at a time.

| Magic | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MSC1` | decoded Steam CM envelopes |
| `MSS1` | direct-message chat sessions |
| `MSM1` | direct-message chat history pages |
| `MSL1` | owned games |
| `MSP1` | achievement progress |
| `MST1` | StoreBrowse metadata |
| `MSA1` | merged achievement definitions + user status |
| `MSF1` | family shared-library apps |
| `MSN1` | friend nickname lists |
| `MAC1` | pending auth-session client IDs |
| `MAI1` | auth-session metadata |
| `MAR1` | mobile auth-session confirmation result |
| `MSD1` | authorized devices |
| `MSG1` | group-chat history pages |
| `MGS1` | group/room summaries |
| `MTO1` | trade offers and merged item descriptions |
| `MSW1` | wishlist pages |

Kotlin decoders validate bridge magic, counts, lengths, enum/boolean values and trailing bytes before producing domain objects.

## Semantic compatibility

Rust parsers are expected to preserve the behavior of the Kotlin fallback, including non-obvious cases such as:

- first-vs-last duplicate protobuf fields;
- `Long.toInt()` truncation where the Kotlin parser uses it;
- fixed32/fixed64 vs varint behavior;
- Kotlin's broader `.bytes` semantics for fixed fields in the few call sites that rely on it;
- insertion-order deduplication;
- stable sorting;
- deliberately lax packed-varint decoding in group member lists;
- malformed nested-item skip/fail ordering.

When migrating another parser, add Rust semantic tests and a Kotlin bridge-layout/validation test before routing production traffic through it.

## Deliberate boundary and next large decomposition

Large Kotlin source files are not automatically Rust candidates. Community, notification, market and confirmation flows often receive an already-decoded JSON tree; moving those mappings through JNI would add serialization and object traffic instead of removing it. Small single-field protobuf reads also stay Kotlin when JNI would cost more than the parse.

`SteamLoginImportService.kt` remains the main mixed legacy outlier. It combines HTTP orchestration, challenge handling, UI-facing error semantics and several authentication protobuf exchanges in one very large file. Its remaining native-worthy protocol pieces should be extracted behind a focused Kotlin protocol boundary first, then moved to Rust in a separate staged change. Replacing the entire orchestrator at once would couple protocol migration to login-flow behavior and make fallback validation unnecessarily risky.
